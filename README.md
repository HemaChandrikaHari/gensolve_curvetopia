# gensolve_curvetopia


Curvetopia focuses on transforming 2D line art into smooth, regularized curves. Starting with polylines (sequences of points), the project aims to convert them into cubic BÃ©zier curves with properties like regularization, symmetry, and completeness. The process includes curve identification, smoothing, and ensuring symmetrical, complete shapes. The final output is in SVG format, allowing for browser rendering, blending computational geometry with aesthetic design.
